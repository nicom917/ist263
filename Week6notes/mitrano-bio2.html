    <h1>Nico Mitrano's Biography
    </h1>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>

   <p> My name is Nicolas Mitrano, and I am currently pursuing a major in Information Management and Technology at the iSchool of Syracuse University; I am interested in blockchain technology and financial security, and would like to pursue a career relating to those interests. Working 19 hour shifts at a banquet hall and counseling developmentally disabled campers for a week are both experiences that have reinforced my determination; I am not easily dissuaded from most things, as giving up is worse than defeat in my eyes. Most of my work experience has been in the service industry, which has reinforced my people skills and patience when dealing with tense situations. One of my proudest accomplishments was running my own computer building/diagnostic service, where I went on to build over 20 computers for different people in my community. Outside of work, I love to play video games and spend time with friends. Although I do not understand much of it on a fundamental level, I enjoy watching quantum physics and history videos on youtube.</p>

                    Welcome to Nico’s restaurant review site! Here I will be sharing some of my favorite restaurants
                    from across the world, as well as some dishes that stood out to me. I have been an avid eater ever
                    since I was a little kid. My nonna immigrated to America from Italy when she was in her 40s, and her
                    cooking always stood out to me as a kid. Everyone in my family regarded her as a professional chef,
                    despite her lack of formal experience. She grew up in a very poor area, and to be honest, never
                    really found a lot of money in her life; despite this, her food was always tastier and more
                    enjoyable than any fancy restaurant could accomplish. Her food did not inspire me to cook per se,
                    but it definitely inspired my palate and love for tasty food! Her cooking did, however, rub off on
                    many of my other family members, including my father and my aunt.

                Some of the restaurants that are covered on this website are personal favorites of mine, while some I
                have never even visited. The main objective of this platform is to expose you to some of my favorite
                foods/dishes, as well as to explain how to make them with love and passion! I believe that everyone
                should be able to cook. As chef gusto says in the movie Ratatouille, “Anyone can cook!”

            <h1>Oishi Sushi</h1>
            <h2>Syracuse, NY</h2>
            <p>Oishi sushi is one of my go to sushi spots in the Syracuse area. It is super convenient to order for them,
                and their prices are very good relative to the quality of their food. It is not really a dine-in restaurant,
                as they are located on the third floor of a building. I mainly order them via grubhub or doordash, and they
                deliver it within the hour every single time. The miso soup is always hot when I order and the sushi is
                always cold. My goto order is their 3 rolls special for $16.95. They let you choose any 3 rolls as well as a
                soup for such a low price. The value here is insane, as you can order 3 rolls that normally cost $8 each,
                and you get a soup on top of it for only 17 bucks! I usually go for 2 spicy tuna rolls and a tuna roll, but
                sometimes I mix it up and get a shrimp tempura roll. Another one of my favorites is the sushi sampler, which
                costs $10 and includes 6 randomly assorted pieces of sushi. Usually it is the standard pieces of fish: tuna,
                salmon, shrimp, yellow tail; however, sometimes they mix it up and throw in whatever the catch of the day
                is, from octopus to lobster.

            <h1> Nicola's Ristorante</h1>
            <h2>Totawa, NJ</h2>
        
            <p>Nicola's Ristorante is a spectacular restaurant located in Totowa, New Jersey. It has a wide array of
                different dishes at different price points, although it tends to be on the pricier side. Some of my
                favorite dishes include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>the Linguini Malafemmina, which is linguini with clams, lobster tail, and shrimp in a white clam
                    sauce</li>
                <li>the Cavatelli Sabina, which is cavatelli with arugula, shiitake mushrooms, sun-dried tomato, and
                    black olives in garlic and oil</li>
                <li>and finally, the chicken saltimbocca, which is chicken topped with prosciutto, parmesan cheese, laid
                    over a bed of spinach and marsala sauce. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The dish that I want to discuss is the chicken saltimbocca. I think it is a staple Italian dish that is
                acceptable at almost any restaurant, although Nicolaâ€™s does it best in my opinion. Prosciutto is one of
                my favorite foods due to its salty texture, and I think it pairs perfectly over a nicely cooked piece of
                chicken. The parmesan cheese adds even further to this beautiful symphony of food, and the bed of
                spinach is the finishing touch that adds even more depth to the meal.
